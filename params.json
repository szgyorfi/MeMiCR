The code assumes that you have Miscrosoft Office installed (or at least Outlook and Word). <br>\r\nTests performed only in MS Office 2010.\r\n2. You'll have to add the **Microsoft Word 14.0 Object Library** reference to your Outlook Project. <br>\r\nYou can do this by going **Tools** > **References** and search the list for this object library. Simply tick the mark and click **OK**.\r\n3. The file **CreateMeetingMinutes.bas** must be added to your Outlooks VBA project. <br>\r\nYou can find instruction on how to import the file into outlook [here](http://www.outlookcode.com/article.aspx?id=28) at the file Import/Export section.\r\n4. After import maybe you want to add a Ribbon Button to the Appointment / Meeting menu. <br>\r\nInstructions can be found [here](http://www.howto-outlook.com/howto/macrobutton.htm#ribbon)\r\n5. If you setted all this up, open an Appointment / Meeting and Run the macro <br>\r\n(if you did not have created a Ribbon Button you can simply access available macros by pressing the **Alt+F8** key combination - choose *createMinutes* macro and press **Run**.)\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
